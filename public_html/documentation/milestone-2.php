<h1>Custom by Kyla - Kyla's PWP: Milestone 2</h1>
<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<h3>First Impression</h3>
<p>The first section of the site will be a large image with some simple title text on top.  </p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>The second section will feature a catchy headline and an image that will change every few seconds to showcase different pictures.  It will also have an 'order now' button that will take the user to the email form where they can contact me for an order.  </p>
<h3>Safety section</h3>
<p>Parents like to feel like their kids will be safe so this section will highlight safety features of the step stool to make parents feel at ease.  This will include a large title for the page, a bullet list of safety features and an image showcasing these. </p>
<h3>Custom options</h3>
<p>This section will focus on the customizable and hand-built nature of the product.  It will include title text, an image and a list of custom options.  It also have an order button (Call to action!).  In part, this is with the idea that the site could eventually be turned into a site where a user could actually make a purchase and I want the design to reflect that feel.</p>
<h3>The construction process/ About the company (me)</h3>
<p>This section will include an image carousel or gallery the user can go through to see images of the construction process or conveying the small-business aspect of the company.  It may also include some short text about the process and/or company.</p>
<h3>Contact/Order Form</h3>
<p>The last section will be the email contact form.  It will have text to indicate that the user can get a quote, start the customization process or initiate an email by filling out the form.  </p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
	<p>Each section is intended to be slightly shorter than the screen height so a small bit of the next section is visible encouraging users to scroll to see what is there.</p>
	<p>Sections of the site are separated by thin grey lines- this is for clarity on the wireframes only and will not be included on the final site. </p>
